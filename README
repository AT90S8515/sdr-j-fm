A simple FM receiver

The FM receiver will operate with AIRSPY, SDRplay and dabsticks.

For creating an executable: install the required libraries and use
either qmake or CMake

Note that the software is made for Qt5 and qwt6. Unfortnately, some
linux distributions do not support qwt in cooperation with Qt5.
